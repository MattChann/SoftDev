00 Notes
---------
 - Is there a way to change the bars to be vertical?
 - The first two bars seem to be touching whereas the others do not.
 - Can the placement of numbers be changed to be located elsewhere?
 - All the bars need to be manually set to a certain width.



01 Notes
---------
 - The graph looks the exact same as expected.
 - The functions provided by d3 and the objects used like the d3 object and result of .select seem to be pretty intuitive (at least by the naming).
 - Perhaps this kind of data manipulation can be used for other types of graphs (obviously I guess) because these functions can be modified to append different DOM elements other than the div's of the bar graph.
